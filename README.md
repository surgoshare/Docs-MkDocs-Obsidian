---
This site is powered by [MkDocs Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material) & configured to visually and functionally work well with [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/), the popular note taking app. 

If working in Obsidian or any markdown notes app, it's best to have the flexibility to place markdown files in the root directory, or anywhere you wish, and this configuration allows for this, bypassing the normal need to place files in the `/docs/` directory, among a handful of other features summarized below. 

## Active Feature Summary
----
### Folder Structure üéõÔ∏è 

#### Hidden Config Folder 
Moves all config files to a hidden .mkdocs directory so not visible in Obsidian
### Styles üé® 

#### Custom CSS
Adds a custom.css file that mirrors default Obsidian theme. 
#### Logo an Favicons
Adds Obsidian logo and favicon for fun!
### Plugins üß©

#### SameDir  
Allows for markdown docs to live in the root directory instead of "/docs/"
#### Roamlinks 
This plugin allows for WIKILINKs support ... presumably it scans the entire directory for the filename and then gets the full path and inserts it as in normal markdown and required for a normal website.
